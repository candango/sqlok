for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. It scans your database schema to produce 
tailored Go structs and methods. This reduces the need for repetitive CRUD 
coding, focusing your efforts on business logic. SQLok provides a CLI for easy 
integration into development workflows. Use it to streamline database 
operations in your Go applications.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
